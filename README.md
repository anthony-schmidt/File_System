# File_System
#### This is a file system that mimicks the behavior of a disk. Run the command with the number of frames that you would like on your virtual disk, and you will be inside the terminal.
#### While in the terminal, you can format files for placement on disk, mount the disk, create inodes, cat files, and many other options that are displayed with the help command.
